# Appendix A: `dorem` package
<img src="figures/dorem-logo.png" align="right" width="200" />

The goal of `dorem` [@R-dorem] is to provide easy-to-use dose-response models utilized in sport science. This package is currently in active development phases. 

## `dorem` Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mladenjovanovic/dorem) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mladenjovanovic/dorem")

require(dorem)
```

## `dorem` Example

To provide very simplistic example of `dorem`, I will use example data provided in [supplementary material](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00078.2011m) of Clarke & Skiba, 2013 [paper](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00078.2011?) [@clarkeRationaleResourcesTeaching2013], freely available on the publisher website. Data set contains cycling training load (i.e. dose) measured using the BikeScore metric (in AU) over 165 days, with occasional training response measured using 5-min Power Test (in Watts). *Banister* model (explained in aforementioned paper) is applied to understand relationship between *training dose* (i.e., BikeScore metric) and *training response* (i.e., 5-min Power Test): 

```{r echo=TRUE}
require(dorem)
require(tidyverse)
require(cowplot)

data("bike_score")

banister_model <- dorem(
   Test_5min_Power ~ BikeScore,
   bike_score,
   method = "banister"
)

# Print results
banister_model

# get coefs
coef(banister_model)

# Get model predictions
bike_score$pred <- predict(banister_model, bike_score)$.pred

# Plot
dose <- ggplot(bike_score, aes(x = Day, y = BikeScore)) +
  theme_cowplot(10) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab(NULL)

response <- ggplot(bike_score, aes(x = Day, y = pred)) +
   theme_cowplot(10) +
   geom_line() +
   geom_point(aes(y = Test_5min_Power), color = "red") +
   ylab("Test 5min Power")

cowplot::plot_grid(dose, response, ncol = 1)
```

`dorem` also allows more control and setup using the `control` parameter. In the next example, cross-validation of 3 repeats and 5 folds will be performed, with additional feature of *shuffling* the predictors and evaluating how the model predicts on random predictors (i.e., dose):

```{r echo=TRUE}
banister_model <- dorem(
   Test_5min_Power ~ BikeScore,
   bike_score,
   method = "banister",
   
   # control setup
   control = dorem_control(
    shuffle = TRUE,
    optim_method = "L-BFGS-B",
    optim_maxit = 1000,
    cv_folds = 3,
    cv_repeats = 5
   )
)   

banister_model
```

To plot model predictions, including the CV as gray area and shuffle as dotted line, use:

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(banister_model, type = "pred") + theme_minimal()
```

To plot model coefficients across CV folds:

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(banister_model, type = "coef") + theme_minimal()
```

To plot model performance across CV folds (i.e., training and testing folds):

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(banister_model, type = "perf") + theme_minimal()
```
