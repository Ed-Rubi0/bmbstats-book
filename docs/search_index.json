As pointed out multiple times thorough this book, simulation and the knowledge of the data generating process (DGP) is very helpful in understanding the analysis and what we are trying to do. To understand validity and reliability analyses, it is thus best to generate the data (i.e. simulate the DGP). 15.1 Data generation Let’s imagine that we know the true vertical jump scores for N=20 individuals. We measure this true score with a gold standard device twice (i.e. trial 1 and trial 2). Unfortunately, this criterion device is expensive or takes a lot of time, so we have developed a practical device that measures vertical jump height much quicker and cheaper. Unfortunately, we do not know the measurement error of this device and we want to estimate how valid and reliable this practical measure is. Luckily for us, we generate the data, so we actually know all the measurement error components (i.e. fixed and proportional bias components of the the systematic error and random error). The below code generates the data for both criteriona and practical measures using two trials and N=20 athletes: require(tidyverse) require(bmbstats) require(cowplot) n_subjects &lt;- 20 criterion_random &lt;- 0.3 practical_fixed &lt;- 2 practical_proportional &lt;- 1.1 practical_random &lt;- 1 set.seed(1667) agreement_data &lt;- tibble( Athlete = paste( &quot;Athlete&quot;, str_pad( string = seq(1, n_subjects), width = 2, pad = &quot;0&quot; ) ), True_score = rnorm(n_subjects, 45, 5), Criterion_score.trial1 = 0 + (True_score * 1) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, criterion_random), Criterion_score.trial2 = 0 + (True_score * 1) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, criterion_random), Practical_score.trial1 = practical_fixed + (True_score * practical_proportional) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, practical_random), Practical_score.trial2 = practical_fixed + (True_score * practical_proportional) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, practical_random) ) head(agreement_data) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 6 #&gt; Athlete True_score Criterion_score… Criterion_score… Practical_score… #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Athlet… 52.9 52.9 52.9 60.2 #&gt; 2 Athlet… 42.4 42.3 42.2 48.7 #&gt; 3 Athlet… 49.2 49.1 49.5 56.0 #&gt; 4 Athlet… 44.8 44.7 44.8 51.5 #&gt; 5 Athlet… 40.0 40.4 40.1 45.7 #&gt; 6 Athlet… 42.6 42.5 42.2 49.7 #&gt; # … with 1 more variable: Practical_score.trial2 &lt;dbl&gt; The assumption of the above DGP is that true score stays unchanged for trial 1 and trial 2. Thus, the only thing that creates variance in the criterion and practical measures is the random error component of the measurement error. It is also assumed that there is no biological noise involved in the measurement error. We will make this example a bit more complex later on, so for now let’s stick to this sand box example. 15.2 Validity “How well does the measure measure what it’s supposed to measure?” (Hopkins 2004, 2010, 2015) is the question validity analysis tries to answer. There are few common approaches to estimate validity of the measurements, with Bland-Altman analysis (Bland and Altman 1986; Giavarina 2015) being one of the most used (also referred to as the method of the differences), linear regression, and ordinary least products (OLP) being a better alternative (Ludbrook 2010, 2012, 1997, 2002; Mullineaux, Barnes, and Batterham 1999). Since we have simulated the DGP, we know exactly the measurement error components as well as true scores (which we do not know in the real life). 15.2.1 True vs Criterion To re-create DGP parameters for the criterion measure, we will use the true scores as a predictor, and criterion score (trial 1) as the outcome. Here is the scatter plot: ggplot( agreement_data, aes( x = True_score, y = Criterion_score.trial1 ) ) + theme_cowplot(8) + geom_point() For the sake of this example, let’s assume that SESOI is equal to ±2.5cm (for the criterion score). We are interested in few things: (1) re-create the DGP components, or (2) can we predict the true score from the criterion score (which implies flipping predictor and outcome variables). Most validity research papers in the sports science are concerned with with describing or explaining the validity by trying to re-create the DGP components, while not many are concerned with predictive performance of the model. Let’s deal with the descriptive (i.e explanatory) tasks first. 15.2.1.1 Method of the differences Using the bmbstats::plot_pair_BA function we can generate Bland-Altman plot for the true score and the criterion score: bmbstats::plot_pair_BA( predictor = agreement_data$True_score, outcome = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;True Score&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Criterion Score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) Panel A in the previous figure depicts simple scatter plot with added identity line (dashed line), SESOI band around identity line, and linear regression model (blue line; this could be changed using the control = bmbstats::plot_contron() parameter). Panel B depicts the difference between criterion and true score (oy y-axis) and their average (on the x-axis). Using SESOI of ±2.5cm, we can conclude that all the differences fall within the SESOI band, confirming that the criterion measure has outstanding practical validity characteristic. How do we re-create the DGP parameters? Well, using Bland-Altman method, both fixed and proportional bias are lumped together in the bias (i.e. mean difference) estimator, and random error component is estimated using SD of the differences. Let’s write a simple estimator function to perform method of the differences validity analysis (do not mind the names of the function parameters; I know they make thing more confusing, but bear with me for a second): differences_method &lt;- function(data, criterion, practical, SESOI_lower = 0, SESOI_upper = 0, na.rm = FALSE) { practical_obs &lt;- data[[practical]] criterion_obs &lt;- data[[criterion]] SESOI_range &lt;- SESOI_upper - SESOI_lower diff &lt;- criterion_obs - practical_obs n_obs &lt;- length(diff) mean_diff &lt;- mean(diff, na.rm = na.rm) sd_diff &lt;- sd(diff, na.rm = na.rm) PPER &lt;- stats::pt((SESOI_upper - mean_diff) / sd_diff, df = n_obs - 1) - stats::pt((SESOI_lower - mean_diff) / sd_diff, df = n_obs - 1) c( &quot;Mean diff&quot; = mean_diff, &quot;SD diff&quot; = sd_diff, PPER = PPER ) } # Run the analysis differences_method( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) #&gt; Mean diff SD diff PPER #&gt; -0.07726199 0.26125825 0.99999999 We do know that the random error for the criterion score is 0.3cm since we have generated the data, and SD diff is our estimate of that parameter. Let’s perform bootstrap method to get confidence intervals for these estimators using bmbstats::validity_analysis function with differences_method as a parameter: difference_validity &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, estimator_function = differences_method, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) difference_validity #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; Mean diff -0.07726199 -0.1768739 0.04312759 #&gt; SD diff 0.26125825 0.1964889 0.34579624 #&gt; PPER 0.99999999 0.9999993 1.00000000 As can be seen in the results, 95% CIs for the SD diff captures the true DGP parameter value for the random error of the criterion measure. 15.2.1.2 Linear Regression method Another approach involves using simple linear regression method, where RSE is used to estimate PPER estimator. Using linear regression we can estimate the intercept (i.e. fixed bias), slope (i.e. proportional bias), and random error (i.e. RSE). Before writing the estimators function, let’s plot the relationship using bmbstats::plot_pair_lm: bmbstats::plot_pair_lm( predictor = agreement_data$True_score, outcome = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;True Score&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Criterion Score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) The linear regression parameters are used as estimates of the measurement error: lm_method &lt;- function(data, criterion, practical, SESOI_lower = 0, SESOI_upper = 0, na.rm = FALSE) { practical_obs &lt;- data[[practical]] criterion_obs &lt;- data[[criterion]] SESOI_range &lt;- SESOI_upper - SESOI_lower lm_model &lt;- lm(criterion_obs ~ practical_obs) n_obs &lt;- length(criterion_obs) intercept &lt;- coef(lm_model)[[1]] slope &lt;- coef(lm_model)[[2]] rse &lt;- summary(lm_model)$sigma # This is very close to 0, but will use it nonetheless mean_diff &lt;- mean(residuals(lm_model)) PPER &lt;- stats::pt((SESOI_upper - mean_diff) / rse, df = n_obs - 1) - stats::pt((SESOI_lower - mean_diff) / rse, df = n_obs - 1) c( &quot;Intercept&quot; = intercept, &quot;Slope&quot; = slope, &quot;RSE&quot; = rse, PPER = PPER ) } # Run the analysis lm_method( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) #&gt; Intercept Slope RSE PPER #&gt; -0.4518909 1.0084198 0.2643645 1.0000000 We will use bmbstats::validity_analysis to get 95% CIs around the estimates: lm_validity &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, estimator_function = lm_method, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) lm_validity #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; Intercept -0.4518909 -1.0759400 0.8336904 #&gt; Slope 1.0084198 0.9825368 1.0220937 #&gt; RSE 0.2643645 0.1859689 0.3575745 #&gt; PPER 1.0000000 0.9999988 1.0000000 Since we know the DGP behind the criterion measure, we can confirm that fixed bias estimate (i.e. intercept) CI captured 0, proportional bias (i.e. slope) captured 1 and that random error (i.e. RSE) captured 0.3. We have thus managed to re-create DGP parameters using simple linear regression. We can also perform NHST for fixed and proportional bias, and random error (RSE): bmbstats::bootstrap_NHST( lm_validity, estimator = &quot;Intercept&quot;, null_hypothesis = 0, test = &quot;two.sided&quot; ) #&gt; Null-hypothesis significance test for the `Intercept` estimator #&gt; Bootstrap result: Intercept=-0.452, 95% CI [-1.076, 0.834] #&gt; H0=0, test: two.sided #&gt; p=0.262 bmbstats::bootstrap_NHST( lm_validity, estimator = &quot;Slope&quot;, null_hypothesis = 1, test = &quot;two.sided&quot; ) #&gt; Null-hypothesis significance test for the `Slope` estimator #&gt; Bootstrap result: Slope=1.008, 95% CI [0.983, 1.022] #&gt; H0=1, test: two.sided #&gt; p=0.322 bmbstats::bootstrap_NHST( lm_validity, estimator = &quot;RSE&quot;, null_hypothesis = criterion_random, test = &quot;two.sided&quot; ) #&gt; Null-hypothesis significance test for the `RSE` estimator #&gt; Bootstrap result: RSE=0.264, 95% CI [0.186, 0.358] #&gt; H0=0.3, test: two.sided #&gt; p=0.427 Please notice the similarity between SD diff from the method of differences and RSE estimator, both of which are estimates of the random error of the measurement error: rbind( difference_validity$estimators[2, ], lm_validity$estimators[3, ] ) #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; 2 SD diff 0.2612583 0.1964889 0.3457962 #&gt; 3 RSE 0.2643645 0.1859689 0.3575745 15.2.1.3 OLP method Ordinary least product approach calculates the residuals using product between y-residual \\(y - \\hat{y}\\) and x-residual \\(x - \\hat{x}\\). This method is used more in reliability analysis when we do not know which variable is predictor and which is the outcome or target, but it can be used with the validity analysis as well. OLP method doesn’t assume that the x-variable is without random error, which in this example doesn’t help since we are using the true score (and the true score is without random error). But it is useful exactly for this reason for the real-world analysis when both variables (x and y) have random error involved. Here is a quote from Ludbrook 1997 paper (Ludbrook 1997, 194): \"It is an important assumption of OLS regression that whereas the values of Y in the population that has been sampled are attended by error, those of X are not. Strictly, this can be so only if the X values are categorical: for instance, conditions, treatments or places. However, most statistical theorists follow the advice of Berkson, which is that if the X values have been fixed in advance by the experimenter (e.g. by specifying times, doses or settings of a pump), then they can be regarded for practical purposes as error-free. When X is error-free, Model I regression analysis is the proper form to use. It includes the well-known OLS regression technique as well as modifications of it, such as weighted least squares (WLS) regression. When both X and Y are free to vary and are attended by error, some statisticians allow that Model I regression analysis may still be used if it is certain, on biological grounds, that Y must depend on X and never the reverse. This is the case, for instance, in dose- or stimulus-response relationships. Even then, the Model I regression line should be used for empirical, rather than explanatory, purposes. When investigators plan experiments to compare methods of measurement, they must assume that both Y and X will be attended by random error. Moreover, it is impossible to decide which method should be regarded as dependent and which independent and because of this it is wrong to use Model I regression analysis. Instead, one or another form of Model I regression analysis must be used. These are described later.\" To plot OLP regression, use bmbstats::plot_pair_OLP function. The OLP regression, in this case, looks very close to simple linear regression: bmbstats::plot_pair_OLP( predictor = agreement_data$True_score, outcome = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;True Score&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Criterion Score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) Let’s write the OLP validity estimators and check the output. OLP regression is implemented in the bmbstats::OLP_regression function. olp_method &lt;- function(data, criterion, practical, SESOI_lower = 0, SESOI_upper = 0, na.rm = FALSE) { practical_obs &lt;- data[[practical]] criterion_obs &lt;- data[[criterion]] SESOI_range &lt;- SESOI_upper - SESOI_lower olp_model &lt;- bmbstats::OLP_regression( outcome = criterion_obs, predictor = practical_obs, na.rm = na.rm) n_obs &lt;- length(criterion_obs) intercept &lt;- olp_model$intercept slope &lt;- olp_model$slope rse &lt;- olp_model$rse PPER &lt;- stats::pt((SESOI_upper) / rse, df = n_obs - 1) - stats::pt((SESOI_lower) / rse, df = n_obs - 1) c( &quot;Intercept&quot; = intercept, &quot;Slope&quot; = slope, &quot;RSE&quot; = rse, PPER = PPER ) } olp_method( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) #&gt; Intercept Slope RSE PPER #&gt; -0.5024828 1.0095568 0.2644390 1.0000000 To estimate 95% CIs for these estimators, use the default bmbstats::validity_analysis: olp_validity &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, estimator_function = olp_method, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) olp_validity #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; Intercept -0.5024828 -1.1085643 0.7298272 #&gt; Slope 1.0095568 0.9843866 1.0226211 #&gt; RSE 0.2644390 0.1859924 0.3579299 #&gt; PPER 1.0000000 0.9999988 1.0000000 15.2.1.4 What happens if we flip the variables? In the DGP we have used true scores to generate both criterion and practical measures, thus using true score as predictor (x-variable) and criterion as the outcome (y-variable) is valid approach to re-create the DGP parameters. Please note that bmbstats::validity_analysis uses practical parameter as predictor (x-variable) and criterion parameter as outcome variable (y-variable). But in the real life (as we will soon see when using criterion and practical measures) we do not know the true scores and we might be interested in predicting criterion from the practical measures. Let’s see what happens when we flip the predictor and outcome for all three methods: difference_validity_flip &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, criterion = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, estimator_function = differences_method, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) difference_validity_flip #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; Mean diff 0.07726199 -0.04312759 0.1768739 #&gt; SD diff 0.26125825 0.19648887 0.3457962 #&gt; PPER 0.99999999 0.99999933 1.0000000 lm_validity_flip &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, criterion = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, estimator_function = lm_method, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) lm_validity_flip #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; Intercept 0.5472786 -0.6599661 1.1190949 #&gt; Slope 0.9894180 0.9770752 1.0135275 #&gt; RSE 0.2618619 0.1813661 0.3559808 #&gt; PPER 1.0000000 0.9999989 1.0000000 olp_validity_flip &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, criterion = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, estimator_function = olp_method, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) olp_validity_flip #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; Intercept 0.4977261 -0.7419619 1.0837733 #&gt; Slope 0.9905337 0.9778841 1.0158849 #&gt; RSE 0.2619357 0.1812142 0.3560398 #&gt; PPER 1.0000000 0.9999989 1.0000000 Let’s combine the result for the random error estimates so we can compare them all: rand_err_estimates &lt;- rbind( data.frame(outcome = &quot;Criterion&quot;, method = &quot;Difference&quot;, difference_validity$estimators[2, ]), data.frame(outcome = &quot;True&quot;, method = &quot;Difference&quot;, difference_validity_flip$estimators[2, ]), data.frame(outcome = &quot;Criterion&quot;, method = &quot;lm&quot;, lm_validity$estimators[3, ]), data.frame(outcome = &quot;True&quot;, method = &quot;lm&quot;, lm_validity_flip$estimators[3, ]), data.frame(outcome = &quot;Criterion&quot;, method = &quot;olp&quot;, olp_validity$estimators[3, ]), data.frame(outcome = &quot;True&quot;, method = &quot;olp&quot;, olp_validity_flip$estimators[3, ]) ) print(rand_err_estimates, row.names = FALSE) #&gt; outcome method estimator value lower upper #&gt; Criterion Difference SD diff 0.2612583 0.1964889 0.3457962 #&gt; True Difference SD diff 0.2612583 0.1964889 0.3457962 #&gt; Criterion lm RSE 0.2643645 0.1859689 0.3575745 #&gt; True lm RSE 0.2618619 0.1813661 0.3559808 #&gt; Criterion olp RSE 0.2644390 0.1859924 0.3579299 #&gt; True olp RSE 0.2619357 0.1812142 0.3560398 As can be seen from the table, the estimates for the random error component of the criterion measure are very similar (although SD diff is smaller due dividing by \\(N-1\\), while RSE uses \\(N-k-1\\), where k is number of predictors, thus we get \\(N-2\\)) regardless of the method and which variable is the predictor and which is outcome. But this is the case since true score is the true score without measurement error. Let’s see what happens in the real-world. 15.2.2 Practical vs Criterion In the real-world, we do not know the true scores. We can only use some type of the gold standard measure. In our DGP simulation we have generated both criterion and practical measures using the known true scores and measurement error for the each measure. Let’s check if we can re-create DGP parameters for the practical measure (which has both proportional and fixed bias, as well as larger random error than criterion) using the criterion score. Here is the scatter plot of the two: ggplot( agreement_data, aes( x = True_score, y = Practical_score.trial1 ) ) + theme_cowplot(8) + geom_point() To re-create DGP for the practical measure, we need to use true score as the predictor (since that is how we have generated the practical scores). Let’s use the simple linear regression method to do so: bmbstats::plot_pair_lm( predictor = agreement_data$True_score, outcome = agreement_data$Practical_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;True Score&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Practical Score&quot; ) And let’s estimate the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals: lm_validity_practical &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = NA, SESOI_upper = NA, estimator_function = lm_method, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) lm_validity_practical #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; Intercept 4.7157542 0.6929173 7.345273 #&gt; Slope 1.0386315 0.9758422 1.132740 #&gt; RSE 0.8518886 0.6168049 1.304054 #&gt; PPER NA NA NA In our DGP, we have used fixed bias equal to 2cm, proportional bias equal to 1.1, and random error equal to 1cm to generate the practical scores.

Thin black lines (spaghetti anyone?) indicate simulation results across different levels of random error in the criterion measure. These black lines are summarized with mean (thick white line) ± SD (blue ribbon). As can be seen, the effect of changing random error in the criterion measure (predictor; x-value), while keeping the same random error in the practical measure (outcome) affects intercept, slope and random error estimates for criterion linear model and criterion OLP model. Intercept, slope, and RSE are only correctly estimated with simple regression model when there is no random error (0 on the x-axis). As the random error increases, both bias (i.e. simulations mean) and variance (i.e. simulations SD) are increased. When it comes to OLP, due to random error in the practical measure, bias is involved in the intercept and slope estimates when there is no random error in the criterion. Intercept and slope are correctly estimated only when criterion has the same amount of random error as in the practical measure. OLP estimated RSE suffers the same issues as RSE estimated with simple linear model. Estimating Type I errors using the bootstrapped CIs would involve slower/longer simulation and will not be considered here. Although I can speculate, as can be seen from the graphs, that these will not be constants, particularly for the biased estimators. What can we do? Well, if we know the random error involved in the criterion score (i.e. predictor) we can adjust slope coefficient (see attenuation effect and slope adjustment explained in great article by Michael Wallace (Wallace 2020, 17)) or we can perform SIMEX as explained in the Measurement Error chapter. Let’s repeat the simulation, but now let’s use adjusted slope and RSE. RSE is adjusted by deducting known random error: \\(adjusted \\;RSE^2 = estimated \\; RSE^2 - known \\; random \\; error ^2\\). The problem emerges when known random error is larger from the estimated RSE, since we are taking a square root of their squared difference. We thus need to make a function that deals with that: adjust_RSE &lt;- function(est_RSE, known_error) { ifelse( est_RSE &gt; known_error, sqrt(est_RSE^2 - known_error^2), -sqrt(known_error^2 - est_RSE^2) ) } Let’s summarize our simulation using adjusted slope and RSE: estimation_wrapper &lt;- function(data) { # Used for slope adjustment sd_predictor &lt;- sd(data$Criterion_score.trial1) criterion_random_error &lt;- data$criterion_random_error[1] slope_adj &lt;- (sd_predictor^2 + criterion_random_error^2)/sd_predictor^2 lm_true &lt;- lm_method( data = data, criterion = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = NA, SESOI_upper = NA ) lm_criterion &lt;- lm_method( data = data, criterion = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, SESOI_lower = NA, SESOI_upper = NA ) olp_criterion &lt;- olp_method( data = data, criterion = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, SESOI_lower = NA, SESOI_upper = NA ) data.frame( simulation = data$simulation[1], criterion_random_error = data$criterion_random_error[1], method = c(&quot;True lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion olp&quot;), Intercept = c(lm_true[1], lm_criterion[1], olp_criterion[1]), Slope = c( lm_true[2], lm_criterion[2] * slope_adj, olp_criterion[2] * slope_adj ), RSE = c( lm_true[3], adjust_RSE(lm_criterion[3], criterion_random_error), adjust_RSE(olp_criterion[3], criterion_random_error) ) ) } simulation_results &lt;- simulation_df %&gt;% group_by(simulation, criterion_random_error) %&gt;% do(estimation_wrapper(.)) head(simulation_results) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 6 #&gt; # Groups: simulation, criterion_random_error [2] #&gt; simulation criterion_random_error method Intercept Slope RSE #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 0 True lm 3.35 1.08 0.949 #&gt; 2 1 0 Criterion lm 3.35 1.08 0.949 #&gt; 3 1 0 Criterion olp 2.83 1.09 0.952 #&gt; 4 1 0.222 True lm -0.0301 1.14 1.19 #&gt; 5 1 0.222 Criterion lm -0.717 1.16 1.13 #&gt; 6 1 0.222 Criterion olp -1.38 1.17 1.13 And we can plot the results of adjusted slope and RSE: simulation_results_long &lt;- gather(simulation_results, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, -(1:3)) # Join the true DGP values for plotting simulation_results_long &lt;- left_join( simulation_results_long, data.frame( key = c(&quot;Intercept&quot;, &quot;Slope&quot;, &quot;RSE&quot;), DGP = c(practical_fixed, practical_proportional, practical_random) ), by = &quot;key&quot; ) simulation_results_long$key &lt;- factor( simulation_results_long$key, levels = c(&quot;Intercept&quot;, &quot;Slope&quot;, &quot;RSE&quot;) ) simulation_results_long$method &lt;- factor( simulation_results_long$method, levels = c(&quot;True lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion olp&quot;) ) simulation_results_long_avg &lt;- simulation_results_long %&gt;% group_by(method, criterion_random_error, key) %&gt;% summarise( mean = mean(value), upper = mean + (sd(value)), lower = mean - (sd(value)) ) ggplot( simulation_results_long, aes(x = criterion_random_error, y = value, group = simulation) ) + theme_cowplot(8) + geom_line(alpha = 0.02) + geom_ribbon( data = simulation_results_long_avg, aes(y = mean, ymin = lower, ymax = upper, group = 1), alpha = 0.3, fill = &quot;blue&quot; ) + geom_line( data = simulation_results_long_avg, color = &quot;white&quot;, aes(y = mean, group = 1), size = 1) + facet_grid(key ~ method, scales = &quot;free&quot;) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = DGP), linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;) + ylab(NULL) + xlab(&quot;Criterion random error&quot;) Using the simple linear regression, we managed to adjust the bias of the slope estimate, although variance still increases with increasing criterion random error (which will probably affect the Type I error rates). Adjustment didn’t help the OLP estimate slope. Adjusting RSE seems to remove the bias for both simple linear regression and OLP, but simulation variance keeps increasing with increase in criterion random error. As stated beforehand, to estimate bootstrap CIs Type I error-rates, simulation would need to be much computation intensive, since for each simulation we would need to provide bootstrapped CIs to check their coverage (i.e. if they capture the true DGP parameter value or not). I suggest you try that as an example and leave the computer to run for few hours. Playing with these concepts (and simulations) is very helpful to understand statistics (and appreciate its complexity). This example indicates that it is not that straight forward to re-create DGP parameters of the practical score using the criterion score, even with the known random error. But, at practitioners are we really interested in estimating DGP parameters of the measures? 15.2.3 Prediction approach Rather than trying to re-create DGP, we might be interested in predictive performance instead. This implies estimating predictive validity using calibration model (i.e. simple linear regression used so far represent simple calibration model). Sometimes certain measuring devices produce multiple outputs, for example heat, humidity, and pressure readings as well as non-linear readings and we can use all these features as predictors to find a calibration model that provides the best predictive performance. In our case, we are interested in predicting criterion measure from practical measure. Rather than using lm_method we have written, we can use default estimator function bmbstats::validity_estimators: lm_criterion_validity &lt;- bmbstats::validity_analysis( data = agreement_data, practical = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 2.5 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 5 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; lm_criterion_validity #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; SESOI lower -2.5000000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI upper 2.5000000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI range 5.0000000 NA NA #&gt; Intercept -3.9394072 -7.2953389 0.7734320 #&gt; Slope 0.9494885 0.8579138 1.0168839 #&gt; RSE 0.8760378 0.7261416 1.1122760 #&gt; Pearson&#39;s r 0.9875619 0.9763234 0.9935317 #&gt; R Squared 0.9752786 0.9532061 0.9871048 #&gt; SESOI to RSE 5.7075161 4.4952872 6.8897943 #&gt; PPER 0.9898416 0.9633314 0.9972420 #&gt; SDC 1.8335682 1.5198318 2.3280204 Additional estimator in this list is SDC. SDC is the smallest detectable change (see Smallest Detectable Change section in Measurement Error chapter), and in this case represents the smallest change in the practical measure for which we have at least 95% confidence it involves change in the criterion score. In other words, SDC represents a 95% coverage in the criterion for the same value of practical measure (or same values of the predictors involved, in the case when there is multiple of them). SDC is calculated using RSE and critical threshold using t-distribution to get a 95% coverage (or simply by multiplying RSE with ±1.96). This is better seen and understood using the residual graph on the panel B below: bmbstats::plot_pair_lm( predictor = agreement_data$Practical_score.trial1, outcome = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;Practical Score&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Criterion Score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) SDC, or Level of Agreement used in Bland-Altman analysis, is depicted with two horizontal dashed lines. Since these lines are within SESOI bands, this implies that practical measure has outstanding practical prediction validity (after calibration with simple linear regression, in this case to correct for fixed and proportional biases). “But hold your horses Mladen, we haven’t tested model predictions on hold-out or unseen data!” And you are completely right.

Using testing RMSE (i.e. mean across CV fold, which is equal to 0.9cm) we can calculate 95% SDC multiplying with 1.96 (or simple heuristic is just doubling the value), which gives us 1.8cm. This implies that using calibrated practical measure score (i.e. predicted criterion score), we are able to predict with 95% confidence at least change equal to 1.8cm, which is below our SESOI of 2.5cm. This concludes that calibrated practical measure has outstanding practical predictive validity of the criterion score and can be used in practice. 15.2.4 Can we adjust for the know criterion measure random error? Let’s use our simulated data to check what happens to intercept, slope, and RSE when changing the random error involved in the criterion (which is now a outcome variable). We can also adjust the estimated RSE be deducting known criterion random error. In this case, practical measure will be the predictor (x-variable) and criterion will be outcome (y-variable). Using estimated parameters with true score as outcome variable will be used as a reference. estimation_wrapper &lt;- function(data) { lm_true &lt;- lm_method( data = data, practical = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, criterion = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = NA, SESOI_upper = NA ) lm_criterion &lt;- lm_method( data = data, practical = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, SESOI_lower = NA, SESOI_upper = NA ) olp_criterion &lt;- olp_method( data = data, practical = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, SESOI_lower = NA, SESOI_upper = NA ) data.frame( simulation = data$simulation[1], criterion_random_error = data$criterion_random_error[1], method = c(&quot;True lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion olp&quot;, &quot;Adjusted lm&quot;, &quot;Adjusted olp&quot;), Intercept = c(lm_true[1], lm_criterion[1], olp_criterion[1], lm_criterion[1], olp_criterion[1]), Slope = c(lm_true[2], lm_criterion[2], olp_criterion[2], lm_criterion[2], olp_criterion[2]), RSE = c( lm_true[3], lm_criterion[3], olp_criterion[3], adjust_RSE(lm_criterion[3], data$criterion_random_error[1]), adjust_RSE(olp_criterion[3], data$criterion_random_error[1]) ) ) } simulation_results &lt;- simulation_df %&gt;% group_by(simulation, criterion_random_error) %&gt;% do(estimation_wrapper(.)) head(simulation_results) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 6 #&gt; # Groups: simulation, criterion_random_error [2] #&gt; simulation criterion_random_error method Intercept Slope RSE #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 0 True lm -2.10 0.909 0.873 #&gt; 2 1 0 Criterion lm -2.10 0.909 0.873 #&gt; 3 1 0 Criterion olp -2.60 0.920 0.875 #&gt; 4 1 0 Adjusted lm -2.10 0.909 0.873 #&gt; 5 1 0 Adjusted olp -2.60 0.920 0.875 #&gt; 6 1 0.222 True lm 1.24 0.852 1.03 And plot the results again: simulation_results_long &lt;- gather(simulation_results, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, -(1:3)) simulation_results_long$key &lt;- factor( simulation_results_long$key, levels = c(&quot;Intercept&quot;, &quot;Slope&quot;, &quot;RSE&quot;) ) simulation_results_long$method &lt;- factor( simulation_results_long$method, levels = c(&quot;True lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion lm&quot;, &quot;Criterion olp&quot;, &quot;Adjusted lm&quot;, &quot;Adjusted olp&quot;) ) simulation_results_long_avg &lt;- simulation_results_long %&gt;% group_by(method, criterion_random_error, key) %&gt;% summarise( mean = mean(value), upper = mean + (sd(value)), lower = mean - (sd(value)) ) ggplot( simulation_results_long, aes(x = criterion_random_error, y = value, group = simulation) ) + theme_cowplot(8) + geom_line(alpha = 0.02) + geom_ribbon( data = simulation_results_long_avg, aes(y = mean, ymin = lower, ymax = upper, group = 1), alpha = 0.3, fill = &quot;blue&quot; ) + geom_line( data = simulation_results_long_avg, color = &quot;white&quot;, aes(y = mean, group = 1), size = 1) + facet_grid(key ~ method, scales = &quot;free&quot;) + ylab(NULL) + xlab(&quot;Criterion random error&quot;) As can be seen from the figure, RSE for the simple linear regression model (where criterion is the outcome and practical is the predictor) climbs up as criterion random error increases. When using adjusted RSE, up until the point where criterion has lower or equal random error to a practical score, we are able to correctly adjust RSE to give us estimation of the model fit using the true score (which is unknown of course, but we have used known criterion random error). As can be seen from the figure as well, OLP method provided biased estimates for slope and intercept. 15.2.5 Estimating SESOI for the practical score So for we have used SESOI of ±2.5cm for both true score and criterion, and it was used to estimate predictive validity of the practical measure (i.e. does residuals fit within SESOI band; i.e. PPER). But we can use outcome variable SESOI to estimate SESOI in the predictor. This way we can estimate the SESOI in the predictor that yields SESOI in the criterion. In the case of simple linear regression, this is done by using estimated slope, by simply dividing outcome (i.e. criterion measure) SESOI with estimated slope: \\[ \\begin{aligned} SESOI_{outcome} = \\beta_1 \\times predictor \\\\ SESOI_{predictor} = \\frac{SESOI_{outcome}}{\\beta_1} \\end{aligned} \\] In our validity model where criterion measure is the outcome and practical measure is the predictor, estimated slope is equal to 0.95, thus practical measure SESOI would be ±2.63cm. This could also be implemented inside the estimator function to provide for bootstrapped confidence intervals. 15.3 Reliability For a measure to be valid it also needs to be reliable, but for a measure to be reliable it does not necessary needs to be valid (or at least in non-calibrated way). In essence, reliability is about reproducibility and repeatability, or how much measure is in agreement with itself. From prediction modeling perspective, reliability is how well measure predicts itself. From explanatory perspective, reliability is about estimating random error within the DGP (i.e. TE or typical error). How is reliability evaluated? We need to make a distinction between few methods. When we have compared practical measure to criterion, we assumed criterion to be gold standard without measurement error (i.e. true score). If that analysis showed non-valid performance, it automatically implied that the measurement is unreliable. In short, if practical measure cannot predict the criterion or is not in agreement with the criterion, it cannot be reliable. Second method is concerned with the scenario when we do not have the criterion or the true score available. Theoretically, we want a measuring instrument of interest to measure the same phenomena multiple times, to check measurement reproducibility. This can be achieved in few ways - we might have a special device that produce perfectly repeatable phenomena that is measured multiple times with one unit. This scenario is simulated within our DGP that we have used so far: the true score stays the same across two trial, which is then estimated with criterion and practical measures. But that is easily done in simulations, and not so in real life. The other option is to measure with two or more devices of the the same measuring unit. Thus, each trial is measured with two or more devices. The assumption must be made that the random error in each device is the same. Let’s see how this plays out with our simulated data. 15.3.1 Reproducibility For the purpose of this example, let’s assume that true score is measured with two criterion and two practical measuring devices (or measured twice with perfect repeatability of the true score). Let’s plot these: ggplot( agreement_data, aes( x = Criterion_score.trial2, y = Criterion_score.trial1 ) ) + theme_cowplot(8) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;Criterion measure&quot;) ggplot( agreement_data, aes( x = Practical_score.trial2, y = Practical_score.trial1 ) ) + theme_cowplot(8) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;Practical measure&quot;) Let’s check the reproducibility of the criterion measure. Same as with validity analysis, we can use few methods to estimate reproducibility: (1) method of differences (i.e. Bland-Altman), (2) simple linear regression, and (3) OLP regression. When there are more than two trials, there are few options that can be considered, and the simplest it pairwise analysis (i.e. 2-1, 3-2, 4-3 or all combinations; this technique estimates average reproducibility) or use of ANOVA or repeated-measures analysis. These will not be considered in this book. We can use the functions that we have written already for the validity analysis. Let’s start with the differences analysis by creating Bland-Altman plot: bmbstats::plot_pair_BA( predictor = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial2, outcome = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;Criterion Score Trial1&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Criterion Score Trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) To provide estimators we will use functions that we have already written: diff_reporoducibility &lt;- differences_method( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) diff_reporoducibility #&gt; Mean diff SD diff PPER #&gt; 0.05560546 0.30504044 0.99999988 Please note the true criterion random error used in the DGP, which is equal to 0.3cm and SD diff which is not estimated with SD diff, even if they are similar: 0.31 (this is due to sampling error involved in this particular sample). As explained in Measurement Error, to get the estimate of criterion score random error (i.e. TE), we need to divide SD diff with \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). This is because, random error is involved in both trials, and thus twice in their difference. Estimated TE is equal to 0.22. If we repeat the validity analysis of the criterion score using true score as predictor, we will get the same and correct estimate: differences_method( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;True_score&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) #&gt; Mean diff SD diff PPER #&gt; -0.07726199 0.26125825 0.99999999 The next approach is to use simple linear regression: bmbstats::plot_pair_lm( predictor = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial2, outcome = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;Criterion Score Trial1&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Criterion Score Trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) We can also use the function we wrote to provide validity analysis using simple linear regression: lm_reporoducibility &lt;- lm_method( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) lm_reporoducibility #&gt; Intercept Slope RSE PPER #&gt; -0.4298105 1.0109424 0.3075601 0.9999999 To estimate TE, we again need to divide estimated RSE with \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). THe “problem” with both method of differences and simple linear regression, is that we need to use one variable as predictor and one as the outcome. This is avoided with the OLP approach, although parameters are estimated using one measure as predictor and other as outcome, but as explained previously, product of x- and x-variable residuals are used instead. Let’s perform the OLP reproducibility plot and analysis using the function we have wrote already: bmbstats::plot_pair_OLP( predictor = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial2, outcome = agreement_data$Criterion_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;Criterion Score Trial1&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Criterion Score Trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) olp_reporoducibility &lt;- olp_method( data = agreement_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, practical = &quot;Criterion_score.trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) olp_reporoducibility #&gt; Intercept Slope RSE PPER #&gt; -0.4982932 1.0124861 0.3076774 0.9999999 In bmbstats, reliability is estimated using bmbstats::reliability_analysis that uses OLP as the default method implemented in bmbstats::reliability_estimators function. Rather than using parameters criterion and practical, bmbstats::reliability_analysis and bmbstats::reliability_estimators use trial1 and trial2: bmbstats::reliability_estimators( data = agreement_data, trial1 = &quot;Criterion_score.trial1&quot;, trial2 = &quot;Criterion_score.trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) #&gt; SESOI lower SESOI upper SESOI range Intercept Slope RSE #&gt; -2.5000000 2.5000000 5.0000000 -0.4982932 1.0124861 0.3076774 #&gt; Pearson&#39;s r R Squared SESOI to RSE PPER TE SDC #&gt; 0.9984753 0.9969529 16.2507895 0.9999999 0.2175607 0.6439761 bmbstats::reliability_estimators provides additional estimators, including TE and SDC.

Again, this recommendation is given under the assumption that the random error involved in two units/trials is the same. 15.3.1.2 Reproducibility of the practical measure Let’s quickly perform the reproducibility of the practical measure as well. SESOI for the practical measure will be equal to SESOI of the true and practical (i.e. 2.5cm) multiplied by practical proportional bias (\\(1.1 \\times 2.5\\)cm). We can either use this know and true DGP relationship, or use estimated practical measure SESOI from the validity analysis. bmbstats::plot_pair_OLP( predictor = agreement_data$Practical_score.trial2, outcome = agreement_data$Practical_score.trial1, predictor_label = &quot;Practical Score Trial1&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Practical Score Trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5 * practical_proportional, SESOI_upper = 2.5 * practical_proportional ) practical_reproducibility &lt;- bmbstats::reliability_analysis( data = agreement_data, trial1 = &quot;Practical_score.trial1&quot;, trial2 = &quot;Practical_score.trial2&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5 * practical_proportional, SESOI_upper = 2.5 * practical_proportional, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 2.75 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 5.5 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; practical_reproducibility #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; SESOI lower -2.7500000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI upper 2.7500000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI range 5.5000000 NA NA #&gt; Intercept 4.3847186 -2.3423560 8.0714488 #&gt; Slope 0.9170754 0.8422666 1.0547194 #&gt; RSE 1.3749629 0.9923160 2.0538771 #&gt; Pearson&#39;s r 0.9718531 0.9378131 0.9877429 #&gt; R Squared 0.9444984 0.8794861 0.9756338 #&gt; SESOI to RSE 4.0001078 2.6825278 5.5671995 #&gt; PPER 0.9400042 0.8036046 0.9875717 #&gt; TE 0.9722456 0.7016734 1.4523105 #&gt; SDC 2.8778305 2.0769413 4.2988143 15.3.1.3 Uses of reproducibility analyses There are few uses of reproducibility analyses. If single unit is used over two (or more) trial using specialized equipment, we would tend not to expect any biases involved. If there are biases involved, the preparation and utilization of the measuring devices might be erroneous, or there might be error in the specialized equipment (i.e. indication of systematic effects). In either way, we do not want to see fixed nor proportional biases. If multiple units are used to measure single phenomena, existence of biases might demand that the units needs to be calibrated. If that is not possible, this implies that exchange of units for longitudinal monitoring is not recommended (depends on the magnitude of the biases and differences). In plain English - you need to stick to one unit for longitudinal monitoring. Assuming, of course acceptable practical reproducibility (i.e. small TE, or SDC compared to SESOI). To demonstrate this, let’s consider the following example. We will have three devices that measure a single true score. Two of these devices (A and B) have same biases against the true score (hence, no biases between them), while one device (device C) has different biases against the true score. reproducibility_data &lt;- tibble( Athlete = paste( &quot;Athlete&quot;, str_pad( string = seq(1, n_subjects), width = 2, pad = &quot;0&quot; ) ), True_score = rnorm(n_subjects, 45, 5), Criterion_score_A = 0 + (True_score * 1) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, criterion_random), Criterion_score_B = 0 + (True_score * 1) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, criterion_random), Criterion_score_C = 2.5 + (True_score * 1.5) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, criterion_random) ) head(reproducibility_data) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 5 #&gt; Athlete True_score Criterion_score_A Criterion_score_B Criterion_score_C #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Athlete 01 41.4 41.4 41.3 64.4 #&gt; 2 Athlete 02 42.8 42.8 42.3 66.5 #&gt; 3 Athlete 03 39.3 39.8 39.4 61.3 #&gt; 4 Athlete 04 54.1 54.6 54.4 83.5 #&gt; 5 Athlete 05 42.2 42.5 42.4 66.0 #&gt; 6 Athlete 06 50.6 50.1 51.2 78.3 Rather than using simple linear regression or OLP for plotting the residuals (i.e. calibrating the predictor), we will use the raw values using Bland-Altman plot. Here is the plot and the analysis using method of differences: bmbstats::plot_pair_BA( predictor = reproducibility_data$Criterion_score_B, outcome = reproducibility_data$Criterion_score_A, predictor_label = &quot;Unit B&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Unit A&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) differences_method( data = reproducibility_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score_A&quot;, practical = &quot;Criterion_score_B&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) #&gt; Mean diff SD diff PPER #&gt; 0.03513462 0.40651806 0.99999335 As can be seen from the analysis, PPER for these two devices is excellent (and this is without calibration), implying that these can be used inter-changeably for longitudinal monitoring. Let’s see if that is the case for unit C (comparing it with unit A): bmbstats::plot_pair_BA( predictor = reproducibility_data$Criterion_score_C, outcome = reproducibility_data$Criterion_score_A, predictor_label = &quot;Unit C&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Unit A&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) differences_method( data = reproducibility_data, criterion = &quot;Criterion_score_A&quot;, practical = &quot;Criterion_score_C&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) #&gt; Mean diff SD diff PPER #&gt; -2.415796e+01 2.939988e+00 2.664952e-07 Unless we are able to calibrate the unit C, we cannot use it interchangeably with units A and B. But unit C is more than good to be used for measurement - we just need to stick to that unit across time. 15.3.2 Repeatability So far, we have assumed no change in the true score across trials, thus no effect of the biological noise. In the next data set we are going to measure vertical jump height on two days spread by 7 days for N=20 athletes. We will assume that there is no change in the true score (i.e. no systematic change/effect), but there will be some biological noise that will affect the manifestable performance (see Extending the Classical Test Theory section). This unavoidably presents the question “What is the true score?”. Well, in this case we can consider it some individual stable level of performance, that varies from day to day due to various factors, such as sleep, nutrition, motivation, circadian rhythms and so forth. Please refer to Borsboom’s text for more in depth treatment of the issues with the true score concept (Borsboom 2009). In this DGP, we will assume that this stochastic biological effect (i.e. random error or biological noise) is equal for all individuals (please see the Ergodicity section for more information about this assumption) and that there is not systematic effect (i.e. fatigue, learning effects and so forth). This vertical jump is measured with our practical measuring unit, that we have shown to be reliable, and for which we have estimated TE and SDC. n_subjects &lt;- 20 practical_proportional &lt;- 1.1 practical_random &lt;- 1 biological_noise &lt;- 2 set.seed(1667) repeatability_data &lt;- tibble( Athlete = paste( &quot;Athlete&quot;, str_pad( string = seq(1, n_subjects), width = 2, pad = &quot;0&quot; ) ), True_score.Pre = rnorm(n_subjects, 45, 5), True_change = rep(0, n_subjects), True_score.Post = True_score.Pre + True_change, # Add biological noise to true score Manifested_score.Pre = True_score.Pre + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, biological_noise), Manifested_score.Post = True_score.Post + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, biological_noise), Manifested_score.Change = Manifested_score.Post - Manifested_score.Pre, # Add measurement of the manifested score Measured_score.Pre = practical_fixed + (Manifested_score.Pre * practical_proportional) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, practical_random), Measured_score.Post = practical_fixed + (Manifested_score.Post * practical_proportional) + rnorm(n_subjects, 0, practical_random), Measured_score.Change = Measured_score.Post - Measured_score.Pre ) head(repeatability_data) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 10 #&gt; Athlete True_score.Pre True_change True_score.Post Manifested_scor… #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Athlet… 52.9 0 52.9 52.9 #&gt; 2 Athlet… 42.4 0 42.4 42.3 #&gt; 3 Athlet… 49.2 0 49.2 48.9 #&gt; 4 Athlet… 44.8 0 44.8 44.1 #&gt; 5 Athlet… 40.0 0 40.0 42.7 #&gt; 6 Athlet… 42.6 0 42.6 41.7 #&gt; # … with 5 more variables: Manifested_score.Post &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Manifested_score.Change &lt;dbl&gt;, Measured_score.Pre &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Measured_score.Post &lt;dbl&gt;, Measured_score.Change &lt;dbl&gt; As can be see in the DGP, we have three components: (1) true score, that doesn’t change from Pre-test to Post-test, (2) manifested score, that doesn’t have systematic effect (i.e. expected or mean is equal to 0) but is affected by random biological noise, and (3) measured score that is affected by both biological noise and instrumentation error (vertical jump was measured using the practical measure). Let’s estimate reliability using each of these scores. Here is the reliability of the manifested score. SESOI for both true and manifested scores is chosen to be ±2.5cm: bmbstats::plot_pair_OLP( predictor = repeatability_data$Manifested_score.Pre, outcome = repeatability_data$Manifested_score.Post, predictor_label = &quot;Manifested Score Pre-test&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Manifested Score Post-test&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5 ) manifested_reliability &lt;- bmbstats::reliability_analysis( data = repeatability_data, trial1 = &quot;Manifested_score.Pre&quot;, trial2 = &quot;Manifested_score.Post&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5, SESOI_upper = 2.5, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 2.5 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 5 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; manifested_reliability #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; SESOI lower -2.5000000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI upper 2.5000000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI range 5.0000000 NA NA #&gt; Intercept -3.4271606 -9.5821430 2.9874926 #&gt; Slope 1.0870906 0.9387198 1.2275893 #&gt; RSE 2.1181964 1.6136378 3.0424513 #&gt; Pearson&#39;s r 0.9394992 0.8345656 0.9759104 #&gt; R Squared 0.8826588 0.6965898 0.9524020 #&gt; SESOI to RSE 2.3604987 1.6480073 3.1187994 #&gt; PPER 0.7475330 0.5785637 0.8622366 #&gt; TE 1.4977911 1.1410142 2.1513380 #&gt; SDC 4.4334361 3.3773827 6.3679238 Unfortunately, we do not know this manifested score, as we do not know the true score. We can only measure manifested score. The estimated TE of the practical measure will now contain both instrumentation noise and biological noise. As explained previously, the SESOI for practical is equal to true SESOI multiplied by practical proportional bias (\\(1.1 \\times 2.5\\)cm): bmbstats::plot_pair_OLP( predictor = repeatability_data$Measured_score.Pre, outcome = repeatability_data$Measured_score.Post, predictor_label = &quot;Measured Score Pre-test&quot;, outcome_label = &quot;Measured Score Post-test&quot;, SESOI_lower = - 2.5 * practical_proportional, SESOI_upper = 2.5 * practical_proportional ) measured_reliability &lt;- bmbstats::reliability_analysis( data = repeatability_data, trial1 = &quot;Measured_score.Pre&quot;, trial2 = &quot;Measured_score.Post&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5 * practical_proportional, SESOI_upper = 2.5 * practical_proportional, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 2.75 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 5.5 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; measured_reliability #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; SESOI lower -2.75000000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI upper 2.75000000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI range 5.50000000 NA NA #&gt; Intercept -0.07812008 -9.5613061 7.5298921 #&gt; Slope 1.01329856 0.8553983 1.2053227 #&gt; RSE 2.49420427 1.9646649 3.3307725 #&gt; Pearson&#39;s r 0.92440336 0.8391887 0.9681646 #&gt; R Squared 0.85452158 0.7042450 0.9373512 #&gt; SESOI to RSE 2.20511209 1.6537377 2.8007336 #&gt; PPER 0.71600963 0.5809328 0.8223197 #&gt; TE 1.76366875 1.3892279 2.3552118 #&gt; SDC 5.22042954 4.1120910 6.9713869 As can be seen from the analysis, now the biological noise is contained (or propagated) to RSE, SDC and other estimators of the practical measure random error. The random error (TE) inside the practical measure is equal to: \\[ TE^2 = (proportional \\; bias \\times biological \\; noise)^2 + practical \\; random \\; error ^2 \\] Estimated biological noise (using manifested analysis TE) is equal to 1.5cm (or we could use true DGP value of 2cm), simulated practical random error is equal to 1cm, and the simulated slope is equal to 1.1. Thus expected estimate TE of the practical measure is equal to 1.93cm, which is very close to the above estimated TE (1.76cm). 15.3.3 The difference between Reproducibility and Repeatability What’s the difference between the estimate reproducibility and repeatability of the practical measure? Well, with reproducibility we aim to estimate sole instrumentation noise without biological noise/variation. This is done by making sure that the devices are measuring exactly the same phenomena. With repeatability, we want to estimate combination of the biological variation and instrumentation noise. Since we have used SESOI defined for reproducibility (i.e. same true score), the magnitude-based estimators were much worse with the repeatability analysis, where biological variation introduced additional stochastic component. In Measurement Error chapter, I have explained that measurement error is the combination of instrumentation noise and biological variation (i.e. repeatability analysis is used to estimate it). I have also explained the use of SDC (and TE) to interpret individual changes (see Interpreting individual changes using SESOI and SDC in the aforementioned chapter). The question is then which SDC should be used? The one estimated from reproducibility (or validity analysis), or the one estimated from repeatability (involving biological noise)? The answer depends on what question we are trying to answer. If we use SDC from reproducibility analysis (i.e. pure instrumentation noise) to interpret individual change, we will estimate the uncertainty around manifested performance change. On the other hand, if we use SDC from repeatability analysis (i.e. combined biological variation and instrumentation noise), we will estimate uncertainty around true performance change. To demonstrate and plot these differences, let’s use bmbstats::observations_MET that we have introduced in Measurement error issues section of the Descriptive tasks using bmbstats chapter. But before we demonstrate these differences, we need to create few more column inside our simulated DGP - we need to have true score as would be measured by the practical measure (without the practical measure random noise), and manifested score as would be measured by the practical measure (without the practical measure random noise). This needs to be done to deal with practical measure proportional bias. repeatability_data &lt;- repeatability_data %&gt;% mutate( True_score_measured.Pre = practical_fixed + (True_score.Pre * practical_proportional), True_score_measured.Post = practical_fixed + (True_score.Post * practical_proportional), True_score_measured.Change = True_score_measured.Post - True_score_measured.Pre, Manifested_score_measured.Pre = practical_fixed + (Manifested_score.Pre * practical_proportional), Manifested_score_measured.Post = practical_fixed + (Manifested_score.Post * practical_proportional), Manifested_score_measured.Change = Manifested_score_measured.Post - Manifested_score_measured.Pre ) head(repeatability_data) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 16 #&gt; Athlete True_score.Pre True_change True_score.Post Manifested_scor… #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Athlet… 52.9 0 52.9 52.9 #&gt; 2 Athlet… 42.4 0 42.4 42.3 #&gt; 3 Athlet… 49.2 0 49.2 48.9 #&gt; 4 Athlet… 44.8 0 44.8 44.1 #&gt; 5 Athlet… 40.0 0 40.0 42.7 #&gt; 6 Athlet… 42.6 0 42.6 41.7 #&gt; # … with 11 more variables: Manifested_score.Post &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Manifested_score.Change &lt;dbl&gt;, Measured_score.Pre &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Measured_score.Post &lt;dbl&gt;, Measured_score.Change &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # True_score_measured.Pre &lt;dbl&gt;, True_score_measured.Post &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # True_score_measured.Change &lt;dbl&gt;, Manifested_score_measured.Pre &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Manifested_score_measured.Post &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Manifested_score_measured.Change &lt;dbl&gt; Now let’s plot measured change (i.e. difference between measured Post-test and Pre-test using practical measure), together with manifested change (as would be measured with practical measure with no random error). Confidence intervals around measured change represent 95% SDC that is calculated using known practical measure random error (i.e. estimated TE from reproducibility analysis - the sole instrumentation noise). CIs should capture vertical red lines (manifested change): measured_change &lt;- bmbstats::observations_MET( observations = repeatability_data$Measured_score.Change, observations_label = repeatability_data$Athlete, measurement_error = practical_random * sqrt(2), # Degrees of freedom from the reliability study. Use `Inf` for normal distribution df = Inf, SESOI_lower = -2.5 * practical_proportional, SESOI_upper = 2.5 * practical_proportional, # Will not use Bonferroni adjustment here alpha = 0.05, # No adjustment in CIs for plotting confidence = 0.95 ) plot( measured_change, true_observations = repeatability_data$Manifested_score_measured.Change, control = plot_control(points_size = 5)) + xlim(-8, 9) Our CIs using sole instrumentation noise (I have used DGP parameter, but in real life we can use TE from reproducibility analysis) managed to capture manifested change (i.e. true change plus biological variation). If we use TE from repeatability analysis (i.e. the one that captures both biological variation and instrumentation noise), we will be interested in capturing “true change” (without biological variation): measured_change &lt;- bmbstats::observations_MET( observations = repeatability_data$Measured_score.Change, observations_label = repeatability_data$Athlete, # Use TE from repeatability analysis measurement_error = measured_reliability$estimators$value[11] * sqrt(2), # Degrees of freedom from the reliability study. Use `Inf` for normal distribution df = Inf, SESOI_lower = -2.5 * practical_proportional, SESOI_upper = 2.5 * practical_proportional, # Will not use Bonferroni adjustment here alpha = 0.05, # No adjustment in CIs for plotting confidence = 0.95 ) plot( measured_change, true_observations = repeatability_data$True_score_measured.Change, control = plot_control(points_size = 5)) Since there is no true change in this DGP, all vertical red lines are aligned at 0. Our CIs in this case represent 95% SDC estimated using both biological variation and instrumentation error. It is important to remember when analyzing individual change how TE or SDC are estimated - does it represent sole instrumentation error (i.e. estimated in validity or reproducibility study) or it represents measurement error combined of biological variation and instrumentation error (i.e. estimated in repeatability study). Ideally, we would need to know instrumentation noise and biological noise. If we know instrumentation noise (from validity or reproducibility study), we can extract biological variation (as it would be measured with the practical measure in this case). To get biological noise, as it would be measured with the practical measure, let’s use the generated columns: manifested_measured_reliability &lt;- bmbstats::reliability_analysis( data = repeatability_data, trial1 = &quot;Manifested_score_measured.Pre&quot;, trial2 = &quot;Manifested_score_measured.Post&quot;, SESOI_lower = -2.5 * practical_proportional, SESOI_upper = 2.5 * practical_proportional, control = model_control(seed = 1667) ) #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 2.75 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; #&gt; [1] &quot;All values of t are equal to 5.5 \\n Cannot calculate confidence intervals&quot; manifested_measured_reliability #&gt; Bootstrap with 2000 resamples and 95% bca confidence intervals. #&gt; #&gt; estimator value lower upper #&gt; SESOI lower -2.7500000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI upper 2.7500000 NA NA #&gt; SESOI range 5.5000000 NA NA #&gt; Intercept -3.9440578 -11.0023147 3.4883182 #&gt; Slope 1.0870906 0.9387198 1.2275893 #&gt; RSE 2.3300161 1.7750016 3.3466965 #&gt; Pearson&#39;s r 0.9394992 0.8345656 0.9759104 #&gt; R Squared 0.8826588 0.6965898 0.9524020 #&gt; SESOI to RSE 2.3604987 1.6480073 3.1187994 #&gt; PPER 0.7475330 0.5785637 0.8622366 #&gt; TE 1.6475702 1.2551157 2.3664718 #&gt; SDC 4.8767797 3.7151210 7.0047162 Measured manifested TE represents biological noise/variation that would be measured with the practical measure without random error. It is equal to 1.65cm. But we do not know this in the real life and we want to estimate it from the TE from repeatability study and know instrumentation noise. The estimated TE of the practical measure in the repeatability study is equal to 1.76cm. This TE contains both biological noise and instrumentation noise. Since we know the instrumentation noise (either from reproducibility or validity study; or from DGP in our case), we can estimate biological error (as would be estimated by practical measure without random error): \\[ \\begin{align} TE^2 &amp;= Biological^2 + Instrument^2 \\\\ Biological^2 &amp;= TE^2 - Instrument^2 \\\\ Biological &amp;= \\sqrt{TE^2 - Instrument^2} \\end{align} \\] We thus get the estimate of biological variation to be equal to 1.45cm, which is very close to the above estimate biological variation of 1.65cm. Please note that the difference is due to me using simulation true practical measure random error, rather than estimated in this sample. We will continue this topic in the next chapter where we will discuss Randomized Controlled Trials and the Control group will serves as a simple repeatability study that will inform us about uncertainty around true treatment effect.
